Corrected CPU Size (Number of Cores) Formula:

CPU Cores = 15 GB / (5 seconds / 1 GB) = 15 GB / 5 GB/s = 3 CPU cores

RAM Requirements Formula:
RAM Required = Data Size + Buffer for OS and Processes

Example: If you want to process 15 GB of data, consider adding some buffer for the operating system and other processes, let's say 2 GB,
RAM Required = 15 GB + 2 GB = 17 GB
